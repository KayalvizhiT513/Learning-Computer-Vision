# Camera Calibration using OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script for camera calibration using a set of checkerboard images. The calibration process computes the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, including focal lengths, distortion coefficients, and rotation/translation vectors.

## Features

- **Detects Checkerboard Corners**: Automatically finds and refines chessboard corners in the input images.
- **Camera Calibration**: Computes the camera matrix and distortion coefficients.
- **Reprojection Error Calculation**: Evaluates the accuracy of the calibration process.
- **Resizes Images for Display**: Ensures the images fit within a fixed-size window for visualization.
- **Outputs Key Calibration Parameters**: Includes the camera matrix, distortion coefficients, and focal lengths.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- glob

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KayalvizhiT513/Learning-Computer-Vision.git
   cd Mobile-camera-calibration
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Place Checkerboard Images**  
   Ensure your checkerboard images are in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path.

2. **Run the Calibration Script**  
   Execute the script to calibrate the camera:
   ```bash
   python camera_calibration.py
   ```

3. **View Results**  
   The script will display images with detected corners, and output calibration results including:
   - Camera matrix
   - Distortion coefficients
   - Rotation and translation vectors
   - Average reprojection error
   - Focal lengths (fx, fy)

## Output Example

```

Focal Lengths:
  Focal Length (fx): 3378.744149359157 pixels

```

## Notes

- The checkerboard should have the same number of rows and columns as defined by the `CHECKERBOARD` variable.
- Images should be captured with the same camera and lens settings for accurate calibration.
